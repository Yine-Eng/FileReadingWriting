ONCE UPON A MIDNIGHT DREARY, WHILE I PONDERED, WEAK AND WEARY,
OVER MANY A QUAINT AND CURIOUS VOLUME OF FORGOTTEN LORE
WHILE I NODDED, NEARLY NAPPING, SUDDENLY THERE CAME A TAPPING,
AS OF SOME ONE GENTLY RAPPING, RAPPING AT MY CHAMBER DOOR.
“’TIS SOME VISITOR,” I MUTTERED, “TAPPING AT MY CHAMBER DOOR
ONLY THIS AND NOTHING MORE.”
